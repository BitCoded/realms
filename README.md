# Realms

Realms is a lightweight game library for C++.

It was designed for one main reason: there needed to be a middle ground between low-level game dev and a high-level modern engine.

### Why not use a proprietary game engine?

Realms is an open-source game engine where anyone can collaborate.

Most game engines are extremely bloated with unnecassary things, but Realms provides a simple way of making games, without the bloat.

### Why not build everything from scratch?

On the other hand, it's really difficult to get started with game programming in OpenGL (or other low-level graphics libraries).

Realms provides an intermediate layer for OpenGL - it gives you all the functionality of OpenGL, but with the ease of a high-level engine.

## Get started with Realms

Realms is open-source, so you can freely build from source if desired.

Alternatively, we frequently post releases on our GitHub, if you prefer to install the library another way.

Thanks for choosing Realms!
